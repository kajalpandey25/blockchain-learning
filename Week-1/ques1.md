// 1. Blockchain:
// - Definition: A digital ledger or record-keeping system that stores information in a chain of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, and once a block is filled, it's linked to the previous one, creating a secure and transparent chain of information.

// 2. Cryptocurrency:
// - Definition: Digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional money, it operates on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology, making transactions transparent and resistant to manipulation.

// 3. Decentralization:
// - Definition: The distribution of power or control away from a single authority. In the context of blockchain, it means that no single entity has full control over the network, making it more resilient, secure, and less susceptible to censorship.

// 4. Smart Contracts:
// - Definition: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically enforce and execute themselves when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries.

// 5. Mining:
// - Definition: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and when they successfully do so, they add a new block to the chain and are rewarded with new cryptocurrency.

// 6. Consensus Mechanism:
// - Definition: The process by which a blockchain network agrees on the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger. Different mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (mining) or Proof of Stake, ensure that all participants in the network reach a common agreement without a central authority.

// 7. Wallet:
// - Definition: A digital tool that allows users to store, manage, and interact with their cryptocurrencies. It contains private and public keys, enabling users to send and receive digital assets securely.

// 8. Token:
// - Definition: A unit of value created and managed on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various assets like real-world items, access rights, or voting power within a specific blockchain ecosystem.

// 9. Distributed Ledger:
// - Definition: A database or record-keeping system spread across multiple participants or nodes. Changes to the ledger are agreed upon through consensus, providing a secure and transparent way of recording transactions.

// 10. Immutable:
// - Definition: Once information is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. The historical record of transactions remains intact, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the data.
